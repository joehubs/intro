I believe in the power of optimization, whether it’s improving processes in a retail environment or enhancing the performance of web applications. My transition from a Retail Department Supervisor at Home Depot to a full-stack developer in training at Tech Elevator represents a natural evolution of my passion for problem-solving. At Home Depot, I excelled in managing a team of over a dozen people, focusing on operational efficiency and exceptional service. These experiences have sharpened my analytical and strategic skills, which I now apply to developing robust software solutions.

As I delve deeper into the world of coding, I’m leveraging my foundation in Java and my commitment to continuous learning to build software that is both efficient and impactful. I relish the challenge of transforming complex problems into streamlined, user-friendly solutions and am driven by the opportunity to enhance productivity and user experience. Outside of my professional endeavors, I’m a dedicated dog lover and triathlete, constantly pushing my limits both mentally and physically. If you’re seeking a dedicated and dynamic junior developer, I’d be excited to connect and explore how I can contribute to innovative projects.
