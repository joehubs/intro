# My name is Joseph Hubbard,

I’m driven by a passion for personal growth and exploration. Whether I’m competing as a **triathlete**, diving into **software development**, or exploring the world of **finance**, I strive to push my limits and embrace every challenge. Outside of my professional pursuits, I love spending time with my *dog*, participating in *fellowship*, and exploring the outdoors through *hiking* and *kayaking*.

I believe in the power of **optimization**, whether it’s improving processes in a retail environment or enhancing the performance of web applications. My transition from a **Retail Department Supervisor** at Home Depot to a **full-stack developer** in training at Tech Elevator represents a natural evolution of my passion for **problem-solving**. At Home Depot, I excelled in **managing** a team of over a dozen people, focusing on operational efficiency and exceptional service. These experiences have sharpened my **analytical** and **strategic** skills, which I now apply to developing robust software solutions.

As I delve deeper into the world of coding, I’m leveraging my foundation in **Java** and my commitment to **continuous learning** to build software that is both efficient and impactful. I relish the challenge of transforming complex problems into streamlined, user-friendly solutions and am driven by the opportunity to enhance productivity and **user experience**. Outside of my professional endeavors, I’m a dedicated **dog lover** and **triathlete**, constantly pushing my limits both mentally and physically. If you’re seeking a dedicated and dynamic **junior developer**, I’d be excited to connect and explore how I can contribute to innovative projects.
